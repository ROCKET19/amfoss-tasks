# Why we must choose you?

I started coding from my UG days and I developed an interest towards it. I likes to play with data. I would love to learn Data Science and Machine Learning.

# What is your plan for the next 6 months?


# How would you contribute back to the club?

I would love to contribute to open source and mentor new people once I get the knowledge.

# Do you have any feedback for the selection process?
